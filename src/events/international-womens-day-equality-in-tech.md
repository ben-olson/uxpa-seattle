  **“Fix My App” Screening**\

  From the creator of Expose UX, comes a new web show: Fix My App. Watch users attempt to use an app for the first time during a usability test. It’s easy to know how to use a product after using it a few times, but using it for the first time is when the issues are revealed. After all the problems are found, a team of user experience experts collaborate to solve the major problems.\

  This special premiere episode is presented in partnership with Ladies that UX and features a female entrepreneur and panel of female UX experts.
