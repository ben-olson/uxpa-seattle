We will have a good time and talk about all things UX. \n\nThe price of the ticket does not include food/drinks. \n\nWe plan to discuss the reality of virtual reality and other realities about user research.\n\nYihsiu Chen is a User Research Director at HTC Creative Labs. Here's a little about Yihsiu Chen in his own words\n\n\\- I have been in Seattle for 5 years.\n\n* In the last 5 years working for HTC, I manage 2 research teams, one in Seattle, the other one in Taipei, so I travel quite a bit across the Pacific. I think my teams are great!\n* I translated Don Norman’s 2013 revision of “Design of Everyday Things” into Chinese, which was published in 2014\n* I am also an Associate Professor in School of Communication, NCCU, which is the alma mater of both Susan and me. I taught Design Thinking in the weeks I spent in Taipei to fulfill my teaching duty.\n* I just returned from a trip to Beijing, China, where I gave a talk and a keynote about Virtual Reality in IXDC 2016.\n* I am currently a corporate sponsor of UW’s MCHI+D program \n* I have way too many hobbies and suffer from constant frustration that I don’t have time for them: cooking, pottery, carpentry, reading, languages, music, etc.",
