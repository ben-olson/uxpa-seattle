A gaggle of Puget Sound user experience meet-up groups are hosting so we can all hang out together.\n\nHead to Eventbrite to get your tickets. It’s going to be a fun and amazing event! Tuesday, Feb 28th at the Motif Hotel. Food, drinks, a panel discussion and networking, oh my. Note that last year we sold out with 400 attendees, so don’t delay.\n\nJoin our star-studded panel of user experience luminaries for an evening of knowledge sharing, networking, and socializing. They’ll tackle how we can shepherd our most exciting and progressive ideas through the practical obstacles we find in many enterprise environments and corporate cultures. Amber Case, Peter Merholz, Joe Munko, and Cory Lebson will share their thoughts on this topic and engage you in an active discussion.\n\nThis event is sponsored and subsidized by ConveyUX, UXPA Seattle, and a collaboration of other local UX organizations.",
